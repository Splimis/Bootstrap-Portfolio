# Bootstrap-Portfolio

Another version of my portfolio. This time with the usage of Bootstrap. The css needs plenty of work, there are some bad practices at work here in retrospect. Progress will be made.


Update 11/15/2017: 
	The entire portfolio has been significantly revamped.
	TO-DO: complete back end for the contact form
		   find better fonts
		   fix small issue with the footer
		   apply third app to the app carousel
